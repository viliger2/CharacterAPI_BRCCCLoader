<summary>1.0.4 </summary>

* Moved BrcCustomCharacters folder from plugin folder to CharacterAPI folder inside Bepin folder.
	* _r2modman clears entire plugin folder on each update. That means character wipe on each update. So I decided to move them to a separate folder inside Bepin. So for this version either update manually and the mod will move everything to new location or back up your characters and place them inside BepInEx\CharacterAPI\BrcCustomCharacters._
* Added messages as to why loader can't load a character from an asset bundle.
