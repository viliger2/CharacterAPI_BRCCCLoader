# CharacterAPI_ModelReplacementLoader

Loader of (BRC-ModelReplacement)[https://github.com/TheSmallBlue/BRC-ModelReplacement] for [CharacterAPI](https://github.com/viliger2/BRC_CharacterAPI).

It hasn't successfully loaded a single model due to incompatibility with bone names. So it probably doesn't work.
